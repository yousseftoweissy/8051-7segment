# 8051-7segment
#0-99, up-down counter on 8051 microcontroller on 2 multiplexed 7-segments display using two switches using 8051 assembly language in kiel software
#count up switch connected to p3.2 and other leg to ground
#count down switch connected to p3.3 and other leg to ground
#2n3906 transistor connected to p1.0, this transistor is then connected to common anode of 7-segment responsible for tens
#2n3906 transistor connected to p1.1, this transistor is then connected to common anode of 7-segment responsible for units
#both 7-segments connected to p2, where a of 7-segment is connected to p2.0, b of 7-segment is connected to p2.1 and so on
